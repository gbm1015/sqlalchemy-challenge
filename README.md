# SQLAlchemy and Flask Homework Solution: Analysis of the climate in Hawaii

## Background

To help with the trip planning for a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii, I decided to do a climate analysis about the area.
In Part 1 of the analysis I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
In Part 2 of the analysis I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1.

### Before reading the homework csv data files and coding in sql

1. I created a new repository in GitHub for this project called `sqlalchemy`. 
2. Inside the new repository I cloned the new repository to my computer.
3. Inside my local Git repository, I created a directory/folder for the assignment and named it SurfsUp.
4. Then added the Jupter notebook climate_starter.ipynb with starter script and hawaii.sqlite, as well as the Resources folder that contains the 2 data files, for Part 1.  For Part 2 the downloaded app.py was used.
  
### Files including data used 

* SurfsUp/Resources/hawaii_measurements.csv - information about the precipitation and temperature observations at each station from 1/1/2010-8/23/2016
* SurfsUp/Resources/hawaii_stations.csv - information about the name, lat/long, and elevation of each of the 9 stations

## Part 1 - Analysis and Exploration of the Climate Data

1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
